# Recreating instagram Landing page. Here I intent to make some changes such as add a footer, change some colors, fonts and spacing.

I added a footer, with similar styling to the original instagram page;
I made some spacing changes; 
I imported a font from google fonts;
I added the link to my linkedin in the 'continue como arsvargas' button, opening in a new tab;
I changed the profile picture;
I change the name references;
I exercised all I've learned about flexbox!
